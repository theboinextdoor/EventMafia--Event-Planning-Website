                <p>Nightlife is a collective term for entertainment that is available and generally more popular from
                    the late evening into the early hours of the morning. It includes pubs, bars, nightclubs,
                    parties, live music, concerts, cabarets, theatre, cinemas, and shows. These venues often require a
                    cover charge for admission. Nightlife entertainment is often more adult-oriented than daytime
                    entertainment. People who prefer to be active during the night-time are called night owls</p>

                    the best time of the day for throwing a pool party, and about the essential items that would make
                    your pool party great.
